### Problem Statement
Introduction
The data set is a masked data set which is similar to what data analysts at Uber handle. 

### Business Understanding

You may have some experience of travelling to and from the airport. Have you ever used Uber or any other cab service for this travel? Did you at any time face the problem of cancellation by the driver or non-availability of cars?

Well, if these are the problems faced by customers, these very issues also impact the business of Uber. If drivers cancel the request of riders or if cars are unavailable, Uber loses out on its revenue. Letâ€™s hear more about such problems that Uber faces during its operations.

There are six attributes associated with each request made by a customer:

1) Request id: A unique identifier of the request
2) Time of request: The date and time at which the customer made the trip request
3) Drop-off time: The drop-off date and time, in case the trip was completed 
4) Pick-up point: The point from which the request was made
5) Driver id: The unique identification number of the driver
6) Status of the request: The final status of the trip, that can be either completed, cancelled by the driver or no cars available
